# Work assignment SwissRe
I quickly fixed this demo based on Use Case "Charlene's Coffee Corner" to proofing that I know my way with Java 8+ features 
like Streams and Junit5 TDD. I did not implement the requirements to the detail. Focussed on demonstrating some skills like...
### what is here
* Mockito and TDD approach
* Fundamental usage Java 8 streams and functional style operations
* Some basic JUnit 5 extension features

There is more to this all I am sure, but that can better be discussed over, like the essential meaning of SOLID, GOF patterns and
the reasoning behind clean, comprehensible and maintainable code. 

### running
